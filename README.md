- 👋 Hi, I’m Bruno - HW/FW/SW developer/engineer
- 👀 At sixty-five years of age and after forty years of work, who could think of engaging like a young graduate, yearning for greater challenges and ready migrating to better opportunities?
- 🌱 What is still possible to do is to give advice, suggestions on the basis of a very long experience, without expecting to build any future of high earnings or dazzling career, but feeling satisfied with what has been done in life.
- 💞️ At that point, work becomes an hobby.
